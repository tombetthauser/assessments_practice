# It is sometimes necessary to be able to break down a number into its prime 
# factors.  The process is called prime factorization.  We can use a factor tree 
# to determine the prime factorization of a number:

#                12
#               /  \
#              /    \
#             4      3
#            / \
#           2   2

# Define a method `prime_factorization(n)` that breaks a number down into it's 
# prime factors.

# example: prime_factorization(12) => [2,2,3]

def prime_factorization(num)
